# JSbegins

My repository for learning JavaScript from the ground up.

## Concepts Learned

- **Variables:** Using `let` for values that change and `const` for fixed values.
- **While Loops:** Useful when the number of iterations is unknown.
- **Do...While Loops:** Guaranteed to run at least once before checking the condition.
- **Git Workflow:** Learned how to resolve "non-fast-forward" errors by pulling before pushing.
